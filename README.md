<h2>Description</h2>
This is my final assingment on my first application programming course.

On the blood pressure tracking form, the user can insert the measured blood pressure values ​​​​and factors that could affect the result such as coffee.
User gets the average of the values. The user can choose the desired time from which the average blood pressure is calculated. Options are the average of all entered values, the average for a week and the average for four days. 
User can add, edit and delete values. Entered blood pressure values can be sent to a healthcare professional.
